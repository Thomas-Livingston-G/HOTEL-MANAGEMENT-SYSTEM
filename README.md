# HOTEL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This Java program implements a Hotel Management System with integrated billing and payment functionality, utilizing the Swing library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The system consists of two primary modules accessible via tabs: Room Booking and Billing. In the Room Booking module, users can enter details such as the room number, price per day, and customer name to book a room, which is then stored in HashMap structures to manage room prices and customer details. A log displays booking confirmations.
